How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding the goal/needs of the customer is important. Asking "why" as many times as necessary to drill down to the core purpose/need of the customer. User stories aid in development because the break the project into incremental tasks that can be completed at regular intervals. This helps meet the needs of the customer by provided working software regularly and allowing the opportunity for input and feedback so changes can be made as needed during sprints instead of near the end of the project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I think an important agile processes is to accept that change will be necessary and will happen in almost all development. It is often difficult to fully plan each step of a program.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development takes ownership of software, communicates well with fellow team members, holds him/herself and others accountable, is encouraging, and considers the customers needs in all work.
